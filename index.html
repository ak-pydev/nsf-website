        <p class="mb-2"><strong>Goal:</strong></p>
        <p class="mb-4">This Research-Emerging Institutions with Large Computing Programs NAIRR Conference aims to expand the NAIRR Pilot community to include educators bringing inclusive AI-educational experiences to classrooms nationwide. This conference has four goals:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>Goal 1: Facilitate increased instructional capacity and a community of practice among faculty at research-emerging institutions with large computing programs who will implement new AI courses or modules into undergraduate and master's educational pathways.</li>
          <li>Goal 2: Identify a shared understanding of best practices for inclusive AI education relevant to research-emerging institutions with large computing programs.</li>
          <li>Goal 3: Improve confidence of instructors at research-emerging institutions with large computing programs in utilizing NAIRR Pilot resources that are listed on nairrpilot.org.</li>
          <li>Goal 4: Develop plans for including AI content in courses at research-emerging institutions with large computing programs, with the use of NAIRR Pilot resources when computational resources are needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-4">A Collaborative Effort:</h3>
        <p class="mb-6">Northern Kentucky University in collaboration with the Computing Research Association, Texas State University, and Kennesaw State University will engage faculty at Research-Emerging Institutions with Large Computing Programs in a series of virtual roundtable discussions and an in-person workshop to build a community of practice focused on increasing Artificial Intelligence education capacity and utilizing shared resources in the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) Pilot. As part of a broader national effort spanning different types of institutions of higher education, this initiative seeks to expand the NAIRR Pilot community by equipping educators with the tools and knowledge needed to bring AI learning experiences into classrooms nationwide.</p>
